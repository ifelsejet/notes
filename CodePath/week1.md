# Week 1
## UMPIRE Method
1. Understand

* Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem
* Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

2. Match

* See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
3. Plan

* Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram
4. Implement

* Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)
5. Review

* Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
* Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug
6. Evaluate

* Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
* Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

## Practice Questions
*  Write a function that reverses a string.

Example:
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"
``
* Substring

Write a function that takes in two strings and returns true if the second string is substring of the first, and false otherwise.

Examples: 
Input: laboratory, rat
Output: true

Input: cat, meow
Output: false
Next Prime

* Given a prime number, return the next smallest prime number

Examples:
Input: 3
Output: 5
