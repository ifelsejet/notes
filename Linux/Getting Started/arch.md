# 9. Arch Linux
## Overview
* Arch is lightweight/flexible and driven by the community.
* Uses a rolling release model like Debian
* "Very hands dirty" but in turn, you can get complete and total control of your system.
## Package Management
* Uses its own package manager, Oacman, for installing/updating/managing packages.
## Configurability 
* Lightweight OS that forces users to really understand Linux
* Bit of a learning curve, but for hardcore Linux users, it is a great choice.
## Uses
* Great for desktop/laptop
* Can't go wrong on using Arch on a small device like the Raspberry Pi (since Arch is lightweight)
